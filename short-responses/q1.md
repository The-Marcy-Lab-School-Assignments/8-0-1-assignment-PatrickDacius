# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
The middleware function is different from a normal controller because middleware functions do not send a response, use routing, and used the express method of .use() not .get()

Nice job! Try and be a bit more specific though. If middleware does not send a response, they primarily pass control to the next function using next(), after possibly modifying the request/response or performing tasks like validation.
